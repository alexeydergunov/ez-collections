/**
 * The root interface for maps.
 * <p>
 * Map in EZ Collections is an analogue of {@link java.util.Map}. Map (also known as dictionary) is a data structure
 * that stores keys and values: all keys are unique, and each key has its own value. It's possible to do all standard
 * map operations: check if the key is contained in the map, get the value by the key, put / override the value for
 * the key, or remove the key and its value from the map. Child interfaces can provide you more functionality.
