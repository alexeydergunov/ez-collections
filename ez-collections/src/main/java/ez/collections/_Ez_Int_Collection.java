/**
 * The root interface in the collection hierarchy of EZ Collections.
 * <p>
 * EZ Collections are very similar to usual Java collections (see {@link java.util.Collection}). There are some
 * differences between them in the functionality, but they are not important. More important is that EZ Collections
 * have one huge advantage: they store elements not as objects, but as primitives. So in this library you can find an
 * implementation of every collection for every primitive type. It greatly increases the performance.
