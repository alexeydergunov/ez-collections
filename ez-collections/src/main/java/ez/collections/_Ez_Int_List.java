/**
 * The root interface for lists.
 * <p>
 * List in EZ Collections is an analogue of {@link java.util.List}. List is the ordered collection, i.e. you can access
 * its elements by their indices (positions in the list), e.g. set or insert the specified element to the specified
 * position, get the element on the specified position, or remove the element on the specified position.
 * <p>
 * Lists are zero-indexed, i.e. the first element has the index 0, and the last element has the index
 * {@code size() - 1}.
